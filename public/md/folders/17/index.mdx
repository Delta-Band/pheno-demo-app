#### Description

A Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) monitors continuous blood glucose levels. Blood glucose levels are measured every 15 minutes for a total period of two weeks concurrent with diet logging.
CGM provides continuous measures of the glucose levels in the interstitial fluid, through a tiny electrochemical sensor electrode inserted under the skin. CGM devices provide a temporal data series of continuous measurements of blood glucose values. Usually, the measures are taken every 5 or 15 minutes, for the entire connection period - that can range between hours to months. Figure 1 shows an example of CGM data collected for a single individual.
#### Measurement protocol

FreeStyle Libre ProIQ Flash device (Figure 2) is used for continuous glucose monitoring for a 2-week period in the baseline visit only. During this time participants are also required to log information about food, medications, physical activity and sleep hours using the 10K application.
During the baseline visit the sensor is placed on the participantâ€™s upper arm back.

Figure 3 illustrates the connection procedure of the device. Once attached the device is also activated. It is explained to the participant that in case of MRI the sensor should be removed before the scan, and that it is not possible to dive with the device deeper than one meter. The participant is requested to remove the device independently at the end of the 2-week period and send it back to the clinic.
#### Summary of available data

Temporal data: A data frame of temporal glucose measures, along with time of measurement.
Computed summary features: data frame containing, for each CGM connection, extracted features from the full CGM temporal data. Features extracted are described under the Data processing section.
Computed Daily summary features: data frame containing for each CGM connection, and for each day of the connection, extracted features from the CGM temporal data. This is identical to the above data frame (2), but data was divided into daily segments prior to feature extraction, and features are calculated separately for each day of the connection.
