### Description

Population characteristics of the Human Phenotype Project include basic information about the participants regarding sex, living area, visits to the clinical testing center, and communication status.

### Measurement protocol

Upon registration to the Human Phenotype Project, people are assigned with a registration code, which is their ID in the study and provide a telephone number and email by which all communications are conducted. Participants are asked about their date of birth and their sex, and are asked to schedule a visit to the assessment center.

Personal and communication data is saved separately in a secure environment from the population characteristics information, which is saved with the participant designated ID.
