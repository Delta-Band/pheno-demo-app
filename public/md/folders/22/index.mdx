#### Description

Bone density was profiled based on DXA imaging, and includes measurements of mineral content in different parts of a variety of skeletal components.

DXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) imaging is a method used to measure bone density and mineral content. A DXA scan uses a low dose of ionizing radiation to produce a detailed image of the body, specifically the bones. The scan is then analyzed by a software to determine the bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) in different parts of the body. This method is considered to be one of the most accurate methods for measuring bone density, as it is able to provide detailed information about the distribution of bone mineral content in the body. DXA imaging is commonly used for assessing the risk of osteoporosis, a condition characterized by low bone density and increased risk of fractures, and for monitoring the effects of treatments for the condition.

#### Measurement protocol

Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) was performed with the GE Lunar Prodigy Advance device (GE Healthcare, USA) and the GE CoreScan software application. Before the scan, participants were asked to remove all metal items, heavy clothing and shoes. Each participant performed a total body scan in a supine position to determine percent body fat, fat mass, lean body mass, and bone mineral density. The total body composition is calculated for various regions (arms, legs, trunk, android, gynoid and total). The CoreScan estimates also the Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) and Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue (SAT) content within the android region. Bone mineral density was measured from the Femur necks, bilaterally and from the spine vertebra L1-L4.
