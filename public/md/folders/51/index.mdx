# Children dataset

### Description
The Children Dataset is a curated collection of self-reported information from participants concerning their children and pregnancy experiences. It includes key variables such as:

* Number of Children: The total count of biological children reported by each participant.
* Birth Weights: Recorded birth weights of participants' children, offering insights into neonatal health and potential risk factors.
* Pregnancy Durations: Length of each pregnancy in weeks, indicating whether births were full-term or preterm

### Introduction
The Human Phenotype Project collects comprehensive data about participants' children. Through online surveys, participants provide vital self-reported information regarding their children's birth weights, pregnancy durations, and the number of children in their families. This focus on familial data enables researchers to explore how parental factors influence child health outcomes.

### Measurement protocol
Data for the Children Dataset were collected during the registration phase of the Human Phenotype Project through the Initial Medical Survey. Participants completed an online questionnaire designed to capture accurate and comprehensive information
