# Lifestyle and environment dataset

### Description
Lifestyle and environmental factors encompass a wide range of influences on an individual's health and well-being. These factors may include behaviors such as diet, physical activity, sleep patterns, smoking, and alcohol consumption, as well as environmental exposures like air quality, pollution, and climate. Together, they play a crucial role in determining overall health outcomes, impacting both the prevention and progression of diseases.

### Introduction
The Human Phenotype Project conducts comprehensive data collection through online surveys, where participants voluntarily provide information on various aspects influencing their health. This includes lifestyle and enviroment data, captured through two lifestyle surveys.

### Measurement protocol
These lifestyle surveys are modeled after the UK Biobank's touch screen questionnaire. Participants receive the full version via email to complete on the Zoho platform, either before or after their baseline visit. A shorter, follow-up version of the questionnaire is then filled out by participants during subsequent visits.

### Summary of available data
