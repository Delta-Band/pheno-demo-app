#### Description

High throughput untargeted lipidomics in serum by Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Electrospray ionization High-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-HRMS).

The serum metabolome is known to represent a variety of environmental, genetic and other endogenous factors (Bar et al. 2020). Lipidomics is a subfield of metabolomics, which is defined as the study of pathways and networks of cellular lipids in biological systems. Lipids perform various functions within the body, from structural components of cell membranes, to energy reserve and regulating hormones. These pivotal functions highlight circulating lipids as playing a key role in a number of age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease and stroke (Holmes et al. 2018; Michos et al. 2019).

#### Measurement protocol

The process starts with drawing blood from the participants during their visit to the assessment center (see Sample inventory for details). Serum is extracted from the sample and is aliquoted into 5 smaller tubes.
The team at the experimental lab performs the sample preparation and samples are arranged in working plates of size 96.
Every plate contains 92 samples from study participants, and 4 QC samples that will be used for systematic bias correction. The QC includes two types:
1. Empty well for blank (position 93 in the plate)
2. Anchor sample - this is a sample that was pooled from a large number of study participants, and is used as validation for the statistical correction methods. Same sample is used repeatedly. (position 94 in the plate)
3. Two NIST samples - these are standardized technical replicates that contain a predefined mixture of human serum metabolites. These samples are later used for running order and batch correction of the data. (positions 95-96 in the plate)
For every plate, the team at the wet lab produces an experimental design file that describes the layout for the analysis of the plate. Mainly, it describes the ordering of the samples to be injected into the MS machine, including the various sample types (10K, empty, NIST, anchor), the tube barcode, their quantity and location. Systematic removal of technical noise is partly performed based on this experimental design file.

#### Summary of available data

Data is available on several levels:
1. Raw spectral data per sample in open source format (mzML)
2. All features of processed data (systematic error removed, batch corrected, plates merged)
3. Annotated processed features
4. Clustered processed features
