# Health apps dataset

### Description
This dataset includes anonymized health and fitness data gathered from users of Google Fit and Apple HealthKit. It encompasses various categories such as body measurements (weight, height), physical activity (steps, exercise duration), nutrition, sleep patterns, heart rate, and location data. Apple HealthKit extends data collection to include more extensive medical and health-related information, including laboratory results, respiratory rates during sleep, and walking stability assessments. Both platforms collect data through wearable devices and self-reported inputs, providing a comprehensive view of users' health and lifestyles. The data is suitable for a wide range of research applications, allowing analysis of correlations between different health indicators and outcomes. By providing detailed health metrics, the dataset facilitates advancements in personalized medicine and public health initiatives.

### Introduction
The Wearable Health Data Dataset comprises comprehensive health and fitness information collected from two prominent platforms: Google Fit and Apple HealthKit. These platforms have become integral in tracking personal health metrics through wearable devices and self-reporting. The dataset aims to support research in health informatics, personalized medicine, and digital therapeutics by providing insights into users' daily activities, physiological measurements, and overall well-being. By leveraging data from these platforms, researchers can explore patterns and trends that contribute to advancements in healthcare technologies and interventions. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for studying population health trends, developing personalized health interventions, and advancing digital health technologies. It bridges the gap between consumer health tracking and clinical research, opening new avenues for innovation in digital health.

### Measurement protocol
The data was collected using standardized procedures to ensure accuracy and reliability. Google Fit gathers data through wearable gadgets and self-reporting, supporting a variety of devices and platforms, and stores user data in the cloud for synchronization across devices. Apple HealthKit collects data from Apple Watch sensors and self-reported inputs, exclusive to iOS devices, and saves data locally on the user's device to enhance privacy and security. Google Fit is intended for fitness and wellness applications and is not designed for clinical solutions or integration with medical devices. In contrast, Apple HealthKit supports the development of digital therapeutics and can be integrated with medical devices, facilitating the creation of apps used for patient treatment. Ethical considerations such as user consent and data anonymization are maintained to protect privacy and comply with data protection regulations, ensuring the dataset is suitable for research while respecting user rights.
