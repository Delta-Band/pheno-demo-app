# Sociodemographics dataset

### Description
Coming soon

### Introduction
The Human Phenotype Project conducts comprehensive data collection through online surveys, where participants voluntarily provide information on various aspects influencing their health. This includes sociodemographic data, captured through two lifestyle surveys (Inital UKBB and Follow-up UKBB survey) and the Initial Medical Survey.

### Measurement protocol
These lifestyle surveys are modeled after the UK Biobank's touch screen questionnaire. Participants receive the full version via email to complete on an online platform, either before or after their baseline visit. A shorter, follow-up version of the questionnaire is then filled out by participants during subsequent visits.

### Summary of available data
