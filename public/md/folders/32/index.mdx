# Gait dataset

### Description
This dataset includes high-resolution gait measurements collected using advanced motion capture systems. It provides detailed kinematic data such as joint angles, limb movements, and body segment trajectories throughout the gait cycle. Additionally, the dataset contains kinetic data like ground reaction forces and joint torques, essential for understanding the dynamics of gait. Temporal-spatial parameters—including stride length, step width, cadence, and gait velocity—are also provided. The data encompasses a diverse range of participants across different ages, genders, and physical conditions, ensuring a rich variety of gait patterns for analysis. All data is collected under standardized conditions with ethical compliance, making it suitable for a wide array of research applications.

### Introduction
The Gait Dataset is a comprehensive collection of human gait data intended to advance research in biomechanics, rehabilitation, sports science, and related fields. By capturing detailed information on human walking patterns, this dataset enables a deeper understanding of gait mechanics and variability among individuals. Researchers can utilize this data to analyze normal and pathological gait, contributing to improved diagnostic methods and therapeutic interventions. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for developing models and simulations that enhance our knowledge of human movement

### Measurement protocol
The Gait Dataset was collected using a standardized protocol to ensure accurate and reliable data. Participants provided informed consent and wore comfortable clothing with standardized footwear. Reflective markers or sensors were placed on key anatomical landmarks such as the hips, knees, ankles, and feet to capture precise movement data. Using advanced motion capture systems with multiple cameras, participants walked along a designated path or on a treadmill at a comfortable pace, performing multiple trials to ensure consistency. Ground reaction forces were measured using embedded force plates during walking sessions. The collected data were filtered to remove noise and processed to calculate kinematic and kinetic parameters, including joint angles, stride length, cadence, and gait velocity. Ethical guidelines were strictly followed, maintaining participant anonymity and data security, making the dataset suitable for various research applications.
