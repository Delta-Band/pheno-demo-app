#### Description

Carotid intimaâ€“media thickness computed from carotid ultrasound.

Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) measurement is an ultrasound-based technique used to assess the thickness of the innermost two layers of the carotid artery, known as the intima and media. These layers can become thickened due to the accumulation of fatty deposits, known as plaques, which can increase the risk of stroke. CIMT measurement can be used to identify individuals who are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and to monitor the progression of the disease over time.

Ultrasound imaging is used to measure the CIMT, which is a non-invasive and painless procedure. The ultrasound probe is placed on the skin over the carotid artery and high-frequency sound waves are used to produce images of the artery. These images are then analyzed to measure the thickness of the intima and media layers. CIMT measurement is a relatively quick and easy procedure that can be performed in most medical settings, and it has been shown to be a reliable and accurate method for assessing the risk of cardiovascular disease.

#### Measurement protocol

Liver and carotid US were performed using the Supersonic Aixplorer MACH 30 (Hologic, USA). Carotid Intima Media (CIMT) was measured using the L10-2 transducer from both carotid arteries while the subject in supine position with head rotated to the opposite side of the measured artery. Evaluation was performed using an automatic computerized system (Aixplorer Mach 30). The intima and media are automatically traced within the box of interest. Mean CIMT was recorded over a length of 1 cm at the far wall of each carotid artery. One measurement was obtained from each carotid artery. Only parts of the carotid artery without plaques were included in the IMT analysis.

#### Summary of available data

1. Ultrasound images of the left and right carotid arteries.
2. Right and left Intima Media Thickness
3. Percentages of the box of interest for which the IMT is calculated
