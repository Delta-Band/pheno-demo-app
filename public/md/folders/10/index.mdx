#### Description

ABI and PWV are measured in the Human Phenotype Project to assess vascular health. ABI is a ratio of the systolic blood pressure in the ankle to the systolic blood pressure in the arm. PWV is the speed at which the pulse wave of the blood pressure travels along the wall of an artery or a combined length of arteries.

Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) measurements were conducted using the Falcon (Viasonix, Israel) device while subjects were in supine position. During the ABI test, primary systolic pressures are measured in each of the right and left brachial arteries, and right and left ankles. ABI is determined as the ratio between the brachial systolic pressure and the ankle pressure on each side providing ABI values per each side. The systolic pressures were based on a combination of blood pressure cuffs and blood flow reading with photoplethysmograph (PPG) sensors placed on the measured limb fingers.  Under normal circumstances, the blood pressure in the ankle will be very similar or identical to that measured in the arm, so the measured ABI value will be close to 1. In the case of peripheral arterial disease, there will be a discrepancy - the blood pressure at the ankle will be lower than the blood pressure in the arms. This will indicate insufficiency in the arteries that carry blood to the legs. In the general population, PAD affects about 10% of people over the age of 55.

Pulse wave velocity is a surrogate measure of arterial stiffness and denotes the rate at which the pressure wave moves down the vessel. This test gives an indication of the function of the arteries. Vascular elasticity is important for their function but, with age, and in combination with certain risk factors and processes such as atherosclerosis, blood vessels may lose their elasticity and become stiff. Increased arterial stiffness can predict future vascular system problems. Stiff blood vessels will conduct the pressure wave faster than elastic blood vessels, so the higher the result of this test, the stiffer the vessel is. Femoral-ankle pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured using the Falcon device while subjects are in supine position. The measurement is based on pneumo-plethysmography from blood pressure cuffs placed around each ankle and thigh and distance measurement between cuffs. The pulse wave velocity value is automatically generated based on the distance and time difference between the thigh and ankle pulse waves and is provided for each leg separately. 

PWV has been recognized as an indicator of organ damage and a useful additional test in the investigation of high blood pressure, it is also a useful method for prediction of cardiovascular events and mortality. Studies have also shown that ABI is a reliable predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality in patients with peripheral artery disease.  

#### Measurement protocol

Measuring the systolic blood pressure with the Falcon is based on a combination of blood pressure cuffs and a Photoplethysmograph (PPG) sensor. A blood pressure cuff is wrapped around the measured site, and a distal PPG waveform is obtained. The cuff is then inflated until the distal signal disappears as a result of the total occlusion. The blood pressure cuff is then deflated in a controlled manner, and the cuff pressure at which the distal signal re-appears is determined as the systolic pressure.

The measurement of PWV is based on the definition of velocity, i.e., distance divided by time. The initial systolic upstroke serves as a time marker. When the arterial pulse wave propagates along with the arterial circulation, there is a short time delay between the proximal and the distal measurement sites, i.e the propagation time between them. The distance between the 2 measurements is measured directly using a measurement tape. The Falcon has a dedicated PWV protocol. The measurement is performed with the aid of blood pressure cuffs. These cuffs are wrapped around the ankle and thigh.
