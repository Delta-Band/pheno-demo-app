# Health and medical history dataset

### Description
Health and medical history data provides comprehensive insights into an individual's past and present medical conditions, treatments, surgeries, and overall health status. This data includes personal health details such as chronic illnesses, medications, hospitalizations, and surgical procedures, which help in assessing risk factors and understanding disease progression over time.

### Introduction
The Human Phenotype Project conducts comprehensive data collection through online surveys, where participants voluntarily provide information on various aspects influencing their health. This includes information about a participant's health and medical history, captured through two lifestyle surveys.

### Measurement protocol
These lifestyle surveys are modeled after the UK Biobank's touch screen questionnaire. Participants receive the full version via email to complete on the Zoho platform, either before or after their baseline visit. A shorter, follow-up version of the questionnaire is then filled out by participants during subsequent visits.

### Summary of available data
1. Initial Medical Survey: A DataFrame containing tabular features representing responses related to personal health and medical history from the initial medical survey.
2. Lifestyle Survey: A DataFrame containing tabular features representing responses related to health behaviors and medical history from the lifestyle survey.
