#### Description

The The Human Phenotype Project study medical conditions diagnosis data is based on self reported, participant provided information. Self-reported medical diagnosis are coded according to the WHO International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) codes.

Medical diagnosis in research studies plays a crucial role in the understanding and advancement of medicine. In clinical research, the process of diagnosis is used to identify individuals with specific medical conditions and to determine the prevalence of these conditions within a study population. Diagnosis is also used to identify subgroups of individuals with similar characteristics or outcomes, which can help researchers to better understand the underlying disease mechanisms and to develop risk models, identify biomarkers for early detection of the disease and for monitoring its progress and to develop  new treatments.

There are several different sources of medical conditions diagnosis data  that may be used in research studies, including direct clinical diagnosis by study staff, use of medical records and self-reported diagnosis, based on the individual's own report of symptoms.

The medical conditions diagnosis information collection in the Human Phenotype Project  is based on self reporting of conditions either through direct questions on specific conditions in online questionnaires or through self recall of conditions diagnosis in an interview with a research staff member. 

#### Measurement protocol

Upon registration to the Human Phenotype Project study, participants filled an online medical questionnaire containing medical diagnosis. During visits to the clinical testing center, participants were interviewed by research staff asking about known medical diagnoses, along with approximate dates of onset. Questions and self-reported medical diagnoses were mapped to ICD-11 codes. Medical diagnoses at baseline were determined as diagnoses that were reported at the baseline visit or with an onset date prior to the baseline visit.

#### Summary of available data

1. Medical diagnosis at baseline coded as ICD-11 codes.
