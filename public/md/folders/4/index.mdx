#### Description

Measures of liver health from a liver ultrasound and 2D shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), including measures of viscosity, elasticity, attenuation, and sound speed.

Ultrasound imaging is a non-invasive method used to visualize the liver and other internal organs. During a liver ultrasound, a small hand-held device called a transducer is placed on the skin over the liver. The transducer sends out sound waves that bounce off the liver, producing echoes which are used to create detailed images of the organ. These images can be used to detect a wide range of liver conditions such as liver diseases, tumors, cysts, and other abnormalities.

Liver ultrasound is a safe, painless, and relatively quick procedure that does not involve any radiation. It can be performed in a doctor's office or an outpatient setting. It is commonly used in combination with other diagnostic tests, such as blood tests, to help diagnose and monitor liver conditions. It is also useful in evaluating the size, shape, and texture of the liver, as well as detecting any fluid accumulation in the abdomen.

Viscosity, elasticity, and attenuation are properties of tissues that can be measured using ultrasound imaging.

Viscosity refers to a fluid's resistance to flow. In the context of ultrasound, viscosity can be measured by analyzing the speed at which sound waves travel through the tissue. Tissues with higher viscosity, such as thickened liver or spleen, will have a slower sound wave propagation speed than normal healthy tissues.

Elasticity is the ability of a material to return to its original shape after being deformed. In the context of ultrasound, elasticity can be measured by analyzing the way sound waves travel through a tissue and how they are affected by changes in tissue density or shape. Tissues with higher elasticity, such as healthy liver, will have a higher sound wave propagation speed and will return to their original shape more quickly after being deformed.

Attenuation refers to the loss of energy of a sound wave as it travels through a medium. In the context of ultrasound, attenuation can be measured by analyzing the intensity of the sound wave as it travels through the tissue. Tissues with higher attenuation, such as tumors or cysts, will have a lower sound wave intensity than normal healthy tissues.

Measuring viscosity, elasticity, and attenuation of tissues using ultrasound can provide additional information about the tissue's composition, structure, and mechanical properties. This information can be used to help diagnose and monitor various diseases, such as tumors, cysts, and liver fibrosis.

#### Measurement protocol
Liver and carotid US were performed using the Supersonic Aixplorer MACH 30 (Hologic, USA). Ultrasound-based liver measurements were performed using ShearWave Elastography (2D-SWE.PLUS) for elasticity assessment, Sound Speed Plane-wave Ultrasound and Attenuation Plane-wave Ultrasound were measured for assessment of liver steatosis and Viscosity Plane-wave Ultrasound for assessment of viscosity as a marker of inflammation 45. Measurements were performed with a C6-1X convex transducer using the UltraFast™ software available on the Mach 30 ultrasound system. All patients were examined in supine position, with the right arm elevated above the head, by an intercostal approach, in the right liver lobe. Acquisitions were performed during neutral respiratory apnea. Initially the Attenuation and Speed of Sound were measured from homogeneous area of the liver parenchyma free of vessels or other structures. Measurements were performed from 3 different liver regions. 2D-SWE and viscosity were then measured from 3 different locations in an area of relative uniform elasticity, at a depth of 3–5 cm using stability index tool (SI) derived from the spatial and temporal stiffness stability at a stability index >90%.
